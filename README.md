Writers Program
</b>
</h1 >

At Keploy, we're always looking for new ways for our community to get involved in what we do. And so this time, we introduce a new writer's program to pay writers from the community to write technical content for software developers. Through this program, authors can now either **earn or get swags worth up to 100$** for publishing content on our blog.

<p style='font-size: 20px;'> We seek a broad range of technical content from experienced writers to produce content for software developers that provides rich detail about using popular tools. We’re looking for content that targets beginner to intermediate software developers on topics like: </p>

<ul style='font-size: 20px; margin-left:100px;'>
    <li> Software testing productivity hacks. </li>
    <li> Tips and tricks for popular software testing tools. </li>
    <li> A case study on testing and testing techniques. </li>
    <li> How to perform e2e testing with popular app frameworks like Node, Java, Django, and Flask. </li>
 </ul>

## How to submit?
To submit your idea, please complete our [Write for Us](https://community.keploy.io/) which contains either an article outline or a draft of your article.

## About you!!
We're looking for diverse skilled writers with deep technical knowledge to write content for us. You should have experience writing content, be comfortable receiving feedback about your work, and be open to making revisions recommended by our editorial team. We typically prefer content that targets beginner to intermediate software developers, but we are open to a range of technical depth.

## The Process
1. **Submit your idea:** Submit your idea via our application form with an outline of your content and a previous writing example demonstrating your technical knowledge and writing capabilities. We will only publish unique, first-run content where our blog is the first platform for it to be published.  The Keyword for the blog should have a volume of at least more than _400_.
2. **Refine:** Our editorial team reviews all submissions once every 3 months to identify topics we want to publish. We will reach out to you to provide feedback on the idea and make any structural change requests.
3. **Write your content:** Once we’ve approved your topic, it’s time to write the content. We'll provide additional guidelines and expectations to help you get started.
4. **Revise:** Submit your initial draft to our editors, and we’ll collaborate with you to copy edit, design a hero image, and prepare the article for publication. You should expect 1-2 rounds of revisions over the next 1-2 weeks.
5. **Publish:** Once revisions are complete, we’ll send your compensation, publish the article, and promote it across all of our channels.
6. **Let's do it again:** There’s no limit to the number of articles you can publish through this program. We love to build long-term relationships with our community and would love for you to be a repeat author on our blog. Start at step 1 again and keep going!

## Technical Writing Guidelines
### Conditions: 
As stated in our publishing policy, we only accept new articles. I’m afraid we cannot republish existing work. We are not accepting agency work, promotional material, or sponsored posts of any kind.
### Rewards:
We pay $ for an article which translates into a choice of:
- 25$ for 500 views
- 50$ for 1000 views
- 100$ for 2000 views
Payment is made after your article has been published. We also run regular events that offer bonuses for writing about specific topics.

## FAQs
### How do I get involved?
Review our process for submitting ideas. When you submit a new idea, we’re going to ask you for details like:
- The article title and a summary of its contents.
- An outline of your article with descriptions of what each section of the article will cover.
- Information about prerequisite knowledge the reader will need to have.
- A link to a previous writing sample that demonstrates your capabilities.
Our editorial staff will reach out to let you know if we want to publish your content and will make recommendations for revisions. Once we’ve agreed that we’re happy with the idea, we’ll send you a contract that agrees on the scope of the article and the compensation. From there, it’s up to you to write the first draft and submit it for review!

### How do you evaluate content ideas?
Our team reviews every submission, and we look for technical content that comprehensively covers software development topics with clear explanations. Explain as much detail as possible and leave no concepts out.

## Plagiarism Policy
The Keploy blog produces original, first-run content that has never been published previously in any form, digital or physical. All code, copy, images, and other content should be the result of the author's original thought, work, research, and self-expression. At our discretion, Keploy will cease all work — possibly without notice — with any author that reproduces, copies, or claims someone else's work as their own. This policy extends to content that has been published or is in the process of being published, by the author elsewhere without prior permission from Keploy. This policy includes borrowing content, wording, code, documentation, or organizational structure from any other person or organization's prior work.
Some examples of plagiarism include:
1. Rewording existing blog posts to pass the content as your own.
2. Copy and paste external documentation without directly referencing the documentation source.
3. Modifying someone else's code to change variable and/or function names, comments, or other elements.
4. Using images from another source, even if you make modifications to that image.
5. Failing to attribute content or datasets published under permissive licenses like the Creative Commons License.
If you're unsure about a question or concern related to plagiarism, please consult with the Keploy content team before submission.

## Screenshots
Screenshots can be a great way to show visual representations of the instructions in your article. You might want to include screenshots of terminal output, tool configurations, or other items related to your content. If you have screenshots in your content, ensure that all content that appears in the image is your unique work and doesn’t include copyrighted images or other content from other sources.

To get the best screenshot, increase the font size of the text displayed in the image to something easily readable from a distance, crop screenshots to focus on elements relevant to the text, and remove unnecessary details when possible.
