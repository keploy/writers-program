## The Process

1. **Submit your idea:** Submit your idea via our application form with an outline of your content and a previous writing example demonstrating your technical knowledge and writing capabilities. We will only publish unique, first-run content where our blog is the first platform for it to be published.  The Keyword for the blog should have a volume of at least more than_400.
2. **Refine:** Our editorial team reviews all submissions once every 3 months to identify topics we want to publish. We will reach out to you to provide feedback on the idea and make any structural change requests.
3. **Write your content:** Once we’ve approved your topic, it’s time to write the content. We'll provide additional guidelines and expectations to help you get started.
4. **Revise:** Submit your initial draft to our editors, and we’ll collaborate with you to copy edit, design a hero image, and prepare the article for publication. You should expect 1-2 rounds of revisions over the next 1-2 weeks.
5. **Publish:** Once revisions are complete, we’ll send your compensation, publish the article, and promote it across all of our channels.
6. **Let's do it again:** There’s no limit to the number of articles you can publish through this program. We love to build long-term relationships with our community and would love for you to be a repeat author on our blog. Start at step 1 again and keep going!

## Technical Writing Guidelines

### Conditions

As stated in our publishing policy, we only accept new articles. I’m afraid we cannot republish existing work. We are not accepting agency work, promotional material, or sponsored posts of any kind.

### Writing Instructions

1. **Be Certain**: Make sure you are confident in your topic and presenting factual information. If you are not sure, please reach out to us and we can help you refine your idea.
2. **Cut the fluff**: Don't use unnecessary words or contextless words. Make sure all the words in a sentence have a contextual relevance and meaning.
3. **Use numeric values**: Use specific numeric values. Instead of writing there are many reasons or some reasons for X, write there are 5(or any specific numbers) main reasons for X.
4. **Optimize subordinate text first sentence**: Optimizing subordinate text means optimizing the first sentence after a heading. When search engines process a content they don't check the entire content. If the subordinate text is not responsive enough search engines can skip the whole content. That's why give the answer early and make it clear as much as possible with the correct format. <br>
<u>Example: </u><br>
Heading: How to do X <br>
Wrong Subordinate Text: X is... <br>
Correct Subordinate Text: To do X... <br>

5. **Match the Anchor text with the Targeted Web page's title**: If you want to use "X" as your anchor text ensure "X" is used in the Title tag of the targeted web page and the source page's Heading. It will provide the best possible responsiveness if you're able to match them providing contextual relevance.


### Rewards

We pay $ for an article which translates into a choice of:

- 25$ for 500 views
- 50$ for 1000 views
- 100$ for 2000 views
Payment is made after your article has been published. We also run regular events that offer bonuses for writing about specific topics.

## FAQs

### How do I get involved?

Review our process for submitting ideas. When you submit a new idea, following details must be answered:

- Article title and content summary.
- Outline of the article, and descriptions of what each section will cover.
- Information about prerequisite knowledge the reader will need to have.
- Link to previous writing sample that demonstrates your capabilities.
Our editorial staff will reach out to let you know if we want to publish your content and will make recommendations for revisions. Once we’ve agreed that we’re happy with the idea, we’ll send you a contract that agrees on the scope of the article and the compensation. From there, it’s up to you to write the first draft and submit it for review!

### How do you evaluate content ideas?

Our team reviews every submission, and we look for technical content that comprehensively covers software development topics with clear explanations. Explain as much detail as possible and leave no concepts out.

## Plagiarism Policy

The Keploy blog produces original, first-run content that has never been published previously in any form, digital or physical. All code, copy, images, and other content should be the result of the author's original thought, work, research, and self-expression. At our discretion, Keploy will cease all work — possibly without notice — with any author that reproduces, copies, or claims someone else's work as their own. This policy extends to content that has been published or is in the process of being published, by the author elsewhere without prior permission from Keploy. This policy includes borrowing content, wording, code, documentation, or organizational structure from any other person or organization's prior work.
Some examples of plagiarism include:

2. Copy and paste external documentation without directly referencing the documentation source.
3. Modifying someone else's code to change variable and/or function names, comments, or other elements.

If you're unsure about a question or concern related to plagiarism, please consult with the Keploy content team before submission.

## Screenshots

Screenshots can be a great way to show visual representations of the instructions in your article. You might want to include screenshots of terminal output, tool configurations, or other items related to your content. If you have screenshots in your content, ensure that all content that appears in the image is your unique work and doesn’t include copyrighted images or other content from other sources.

To get the best screenshot, increase the font size of the text displayed in the image to something easily readable from a distance, crop screenshots to focus on elements relevant to the text, and remove unnecessary details when possible.
